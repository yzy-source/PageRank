# PageRank

Compute the PageRank scores on the Wikipedia dataset.

In this project, you need to report the Top 100 NodeID with their PageRank scores. You can choose different parameters, such as the teleport parameter, to compare different results. One result you must report is that when setting the teleport parameter to 0.85.
In addition to the basic PageRank algorithm, you need to implement the Block-Stripe Update algorithm. Consider the dead ends and spider trap, optimize the sparse matrix and implement a block matrix.
